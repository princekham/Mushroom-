According to above site - 200 lux is required for lighting a mushroom room ( 200 lux means that there are 200 lumens of light spread over each square meter of a surface)

## CO2 Level
- Spawn Run Phase: During this initial phase, the CO2 levels should be between 10,000 - 20,000 ppm to promote mycelium growthhttps://www.co2meter.com/blogs/news/co2-mushroom-farminghttps://atlas-scientific.com/blog/why-you-need-a-co2-meter-for-growing-mushrooms/.

- Fruiting Phase: Once the mushrooms begin to form, the CO2 levels should be reduced to no more than 1,000 ppm, with an optimal range between 500 and 800 ppmhttps://www.co2meter.com/blogs/news/co2-mushroom-farminghttps://atlas-scientific.com/blog/why-you-need-a-co2-meter-for-growing-mushrooms/.
